Usually, the middlemen involved in trading of vegetables and fruits get most of the money and the farmers are deprived of their basic rights.Lately, many farmers are committing suicides because they do not have enough money to satisfy their basic needs of life and hence they resort to doing such heinous things.<br> Many a times their crops get destroyed due to the effects of global warming and they do not get any kind of reimbursement from the government. This ultimately makes them poor and scarce in resources and makes their life miserable.<br>Recently, government has taken some steps to save farmers and their life. Government has released them from all types of loans and they are also paid Rs.6000 annually so that they can have some extra earning other than their profession. Also, government has taken steps to reserve seats for their children in various schools and colleges so that they should not be deprived of education. All these measures are taken to help them lead a better and healthy life. Although there’s a lot more than can be done to improve their living, however, these small steps can help them live a life they deserve.</p5>
